In C++

--> To minimize the potential for errors, C++ has adopted the convention of using header files to contain declarations.
    You make the declarations in a header file, then use the #include directive in every .cpp file or other header file that 
    requires that declaration.

--> iostream is a header file that allows us to use input and output.

--> bits/stdc++.h is a header file that import every single c++ header file.

(disadvantage of using bits/stdc++.h header file is it increases compilation time because it has to search through every 
possible functions.)

--> #include <filename> -> the preprocessor searches in an implementation-defined manner, normally in directories 
                           pre-designated by the compiler/IDE. This method is normally used to include header files for the C 
                           standard library and other header files associated with the target platform.

    #include "filename" -> the preprocessor also searches in an implementation defined manner, but one that is normally used to 
                           include programmer-defined header files and typically includes same directory as the file containing 
                           the directive.
