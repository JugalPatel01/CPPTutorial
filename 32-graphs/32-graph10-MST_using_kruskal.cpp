    * Minimum spanning tree (using krushkals' algorithm )

    # what is spanning tree?
    -> for undirected and connected graph G(V,E), a spanning tree of the graph G is a tree that spans G(that is, it includes
       every vertex of G ) and is a subgraph of G(every edge in the tree belongs to G).
    NOTE 1) : there can be a many spanning tree for one graph.
    NOTE 2) : If there are total N vertices in the graph then there are total N-1 edges in the spanning tree.

    # what is cost of spanning tree?
    -> the cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree.

    Now,
    # what is minimum spanning tree?
    -> Minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree where the cost is minimum amont all the spanning trees.
    NOTE : There also can be many minimum spanning tree.

                graph G


    Krushkal's algorithm :
    1. sort the edges in increasing order of their weights.
    2. Iterate in the sorted edges,
        if inclusion of i'th edge leads to a cycle, then skip, this edge.
        else add it into MST.

    sorted edges for above graph is :
     { 1(6,8), 1(7,8), 2(3,4), 5(3,6), 5(1,2), 6(1,3), 7(5,7), 9(2,4) ,10(5,6)}

    -> add edges one by one and check for whether that including that edge make cycle or not.
    -> we get { 1(6,8), 1(7,8), 2(3,4), 5(3,6), 5(1,2), 6(1,3), 7(5,7) }
    so, here we covered all the nodes and there is no cycle now if we insert 9(2,4) then it forms a cycle.

     Now MST of above graph G is :

           (0)             (4)
         5/   \ 6             \7
         /     \   5           \
        (1)   (2)------(5)    (6)
              /2        1\    /1
             /            \  /
           (3)            (7)

    cost of MST is = 5 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 27

    Time-complexity : O(Edges * log (nodes))
                    because of sorting takes O(edges*log(edges))
                    and we know in complete graph there is max edges = (nodes)*(nodes-1) = O((nodes)Â²)
                    so, O(edges*2*log(nodes)) = O(edges*log(edges))

    space-complexity : O(Edges + Nodes) = O(Edges)
